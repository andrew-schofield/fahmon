Please make sure you have read the REQUIRES file before installing FahMon.

Windows
=======

If you have the installer, the process is self explanatory.

If you have the zip file, it can be extracted wherever you want.

Linux
=====

If your distro is supported by the binary builds on the website, the easiest way
to install FahMon is to use one of them. Installation is as simple as double-
clicking the package and entering your root password.

If you need to build from source, follow the instructions below.

FahMon uses the familiar ./configure; make method for software building. Under
normal circumstances these are the only commands you will need to run. Configure
will detect and setup the necessary software and files, and make will compile
the software for you.

Full installation instructions:

 cd <fahmon source folder>
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Depending on your Linux distribution, you may not have (or use) sudo. In which
case you need to login as root with `su`, run `make install`, then `exit`
To run FahMon, either run "fahmon" from a shell (it will work from anywhere in
the system, no more need for shell scripts), or launch it from your Desktop
Environment's Applications menu (if supported). You can add a shortcut item
manually if your DE is not supported.
