/**
 * Progress management class.
 * This class displays some progress information to the user, thanks to a wxProgressDialog
 *
 * It is easier to use when different tasks have to be performed, because each of them does not have to
 * know the percentage of work they represent compared to the total work to be done
 *
 * It is also easier to use in the case where a method will sometimes not display its progress (silent mode)
 * Thus, the test does not have to be done in the method itself, making it clearer to read (and to write).
