To compile FahMon under Linux, you will need:
 - gcc (either 3.x or 4.x)
 - wxGTK >= 2.6.0 (runtime and headers)
 - scons (which is a make replacement)



If wxGTK is correctly installed on your system, you should be able to execute the command wx-config from any directory:
athropos@ruby$ wx-config --list

Default config is gtk2-unicode-release-2.6
Default config will be used for output
Alternate matches:
  gtk2-unicode-debug-2.6



If you have no problem with wx-config, you should be able to compile FahMon:
athropos@ruby$ cd src
athropos@ruby$ scons

If everything went OK, you can execute FahMon:
athropos@ruby$ ./fahmon



If you intend to launch FahMon from another directory (e.g. with a shortcut from the gnome-panel), you should write a little script like this one:

--
#!/bin/sh

export BROWSER="firefox"

cd /path/to/fahmon/
./fahmon
--

This way, fahmon will use the correct directory to store data.
