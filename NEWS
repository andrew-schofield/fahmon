Please send FahMon bug reports to andrew_s@fahmon.net.

Version 2.3.99.1

* Fixed nasty crash-bug on Windows when monitoring Linux clients.

Version 2.3.99

* Removed WU info panel from default view.
* Lots of performance changes.
* You can now monitor clients via FTP and HTTP.
* You can upload web output to an FTP server automatically.

Version 2.3.4

* This version fixes the nasty bug in 2.3.3 which cause clients to fail to
  update after non-specific periods of time. This was caused by a typo in them
  update queue handler which now works properly.
* CPU usage has been reduced slightly when refreshing clients thanks to a
  re-worked message logger.
* clientstab.txt is now tab-delimited. This has no effect on FahMon, but may
  break compatibility with other tools that read this file.

Version 2.3.3

* The client list view has been made much more configurable and additional
  columns can be added with a right click on the column title.
* You can now completely hide the WU Info panel on the right hand side of the
  main FahMon window.
* Clients can now be managed from the main menu instead of a right click menu
  in the clients list.
* Clients can now be manually disabled if you don't want FahMon to monitor them.
* Paused clients can now be detected and shouldn't register as *hung*.
* A number of debilitating bugs that affected GPU monitoring have been fixed.
* FahMon on Windows now follows MS guidelines for storage of settings. This
  means no more problems with UAC on Vista when downloading project updates.

Version 2.3.2b

* Several behavioural fixes to dialogs and a number of visual fixes including
  displaying fractional deadlines correctly.
* Windows now maximises from the System tray correctly. Finally.
* A number of performance and behaviour tweaks to the OS X build.

Version 2.3.2a

* FahMon now runs on Mac OS X!
* Several annoying Win32 bugs have been squashed, and the endian swap bug has
  been fixed.

Version 2.3.2

* Lots of bug fixes in this release to make FahMon more stable, there should be
  far fewer instances of FahMon crashing for no apparent reason, and CPU usage
  whilst reloading clients has been decreased.
* Several bits of data are now retreived using core code from qd (Queue Dumper)
  http://linuxminded.xs4all.nl/?target=software-qd-tools.plc
* Web output is now completely configurable thanks to a new templating system
  which allows you to create custom output pages.
* Documentation should now be much more understandable.

Version 2.3.1

* The most obvious new change to version 2.3.1 is the new "WebApp" module. This
  enables you to export the monitoring information provided by FahMon to a web-
  page, or to a file for viewing over a secure shell.
* Drag and drop capability has been added to the client-list too, so you just
  drag and drop your FAH folder onto the list, and the add client dialog appears
  with the location field already filled in. This works for multiple clients
  too, you just get presented with multiple dialogs in succession.
* An update notification system has been added, which although very basic, will
  alert you that a new version of FahMon has been released. You can either check
  manually from the menu item, or allow FahMon to check every time it starts.

Version 2.3.0

* First ever NEWS entry thanks to the GNU build system. The scons installation
  system has been removed completely from the source package, so now you should
  use the familiar "./configure; make; make install;" method to install FahMon.
* You can now run FahMon from anywhere on the system (if you're using Linux),
  and assuming you compiled it right, it will always load the images properly,
  no more scripting required.
* Several minor bugs have been squashed, and a couple of new features added that
  were requested.
* I've built some packages for the Linux distros I happen to have installed, but
  these may not work (depends if I've built them right or not), so if you find
  that they're broken, please let me know.
