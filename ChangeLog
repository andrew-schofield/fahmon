    * WebApp web output now copies images automatically.
    * Fixed bug in project update system that prevented client list reloading

      own output designs.

      missing the information required.
    * Monitoring system now calculates how many markers are in a log file based
      on FAHlog.txt analysis and only uses the psummary "frame" count if no
      accurate determination can be made.
    * Fixed behaviour when FAHlog reports odd completion percentages like 100%->
      200% instead of 0%->100%.

v2.3.1 (30/10/07)

    General

    * Updated and improved documentation (this is still "Work in Progress").
    * Added Czech translation.
    * Preferences dialog and client list now save changes immediately, which
      should help in situations where FahMon crashes, like fast-user-switching
      or closing RDP/VNC sessions.
    * Added Drag-and-Drop function to the client list to allow new clients to be
      added more easily.
    * Add Gromacs SMP CVS (GROCVS) core support.
    * Adjusted margin on the benchmarks dialog.
    * Fixed bug in "Effective Duration" code that produced incorrect results
      when calculating values for WUs with less than 100 frames.
    * Detailed instructions on how to compile fahmon using the MS Free Tools are
      now provided.
    * Altered progress detection method to use FAHlog.txt, this should help with
      cores that don't update unitinfo.txt in a timely fashion, or at all.
      Unitinfo.txt is still used as a fallback if 1) The projectId is unknown,
      2) The WU is still in the "startup" phase (i.e. yellow).
    * Added WebApp module. You can now export the monitoring status to 3
      different formats, WebApp - a fancy jscript powered web page that mimics
      the FahMon interface; Simple Web - a simple web page containing useful
      data arranged in a simple table; Simple Text - similar to Simple Web, but
      optimised for shell based viewing - useful for monitoring over SSH.
    * Removed redundant "display deadlines in days option". The format is now
      controlled by the old "Display ETA as" option which has been renamed to
      "Display dates as"
    * Added menu item to cycle through ETA display styles as requested.
    * Updated about dialog to use new website
    * HTTP requests from FahMon now send a User-Agent string (i.e. FahMon/2.3.1)
    * Update notification system added
    * Added Dutch translation
    * Added Brazilian Portuguese translation
    * Added Spanish translation
    * New application icon, including Vista-required dimensions

v2.3.0 (10/09/07)

    Linux

    * Replaced scons with GNU build system (makes it easier for packagers).
    * Altered image path to now use standard directory (like
      /usr/share/pixmaps/fahmon).
    * Altered message.log location to use ~/.fahmon/
    * Above changes mean FahMon can be run from anywhere on the system without
      worrying about being in the right directory first.
    * Automatically creates Application Menu shortcut using GNU build system.
    * Fixed typo that caused default file manager to be set to "Other" instead
      of "Konqueror" on a fresh install.
    * psummary parser altered to change the decimal point symbol on the fly,
      thus allowing non-english users to display "," instead of "."

    Windows

    * Created new installer using NSIS

    General

    * Documentation altered to fit with GNU build system.
    * Fixed regression that caused FahMon to lose settings on OS shutdown or
      logoff.
    * Added Double Gromacs B (DGROMACSB) core support.
    * Adapted asynchronous client detection to work with updated timezone
      conversion system. Asynchronous clients should no longer appear "hung"
      when "ignore asynchronous clocks" is enabled. This has the potential to
      display the state incorrectly for clients having very long frame times
      (close to 1 day). For the most accurate state detection, client clocks
      should be as in-sync as possible (use NTP).
    * Fixed some items on the preferences dialog that didn't automatically
      refresh the client list when the preferences were applied/saved.
    * The information panel now shows the full PRCG data for the current client
      (if readable).
    * The "effective" rate can now be used to calculate ETA and PPD. This bases
      the frame times on the total running time of the WU since it was
      downloaded, thus takes into account times when the client was not actually
      processing the WU.
    * Fixed bug which caused incorrect sorting by PPD when there were stopped
      clients in the list.
    * Double clicking on clients will open the folder containing that client.
    * Altered WU information panel to show deadlines as days, hours, minutes to
      match the ETA display.
    * Improved instance handling to raise the previous instance instead of
      producing a warning message. Uses DDE on Win32 and Unix sockets on Unix.
    * Made log processing routines more robust to cope with messy lines in
      FAHlog.txt created by the Windows SMP client.
    * Source package now contains all files necessary to build on Linux, MS
      Windows and OSX. However, they are only guaranteed to compile sucessfully
      on Linux. MS Windows can be made to work, OSX is unknown at this point.
    * FahMon is now internationalised, and comes with translations for: British
      English, French, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish.

v2.2.2 (07/07/07)

    * Added preliminary detection for hung clients
    * Fixed bug which prevented reloading selected client data after being
      restored from the system tray
    * Fixed regression which caused inaccessible clients to report an incorrect
      state on FahMon launch
    * Fixed regression that often caused an incorrect xyz file to be saved when
      experimental reload system was activated
    * Fixed (longstanding) major issue with state detection and timezone
      conversion which caused clients to have an unknown state when the local
      timezone has passed 00:00 and the client hasn't.
    * Fixed bug which prevented you from running FahMon in "start minimised"
      mode without "enable tray icon" being set
    * Fixed another bug relating to window size not restoring correctly. If the
      frame is ever detected to be 0x0, default values are used instead
    * Client list colour scheme now follows system on both Windows and Linux
    * Made more code compatible with newer versions of wxWidgets (Win32)

v2.2.1a (13/06/07)

      unsynced clocks
    * Fixed empty log crash bug

      ck_wong and goober_dvd for the patches)
    * A local file can now be used as a project data source, and the download
      parameters can be changed
    * Added a tray menu showing number of clients and PPD
    * Right click menu for clients now allows you to open the client folder in
      your file manager
    * Client list can be sorted by PPD and Status
    * Inaccessible clients can be included in sorting, by default they are
      always displayed last.
