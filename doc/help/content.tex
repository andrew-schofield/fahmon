\section{Introduction}

This section gives an overview of FahMon, what it is and is not, and what it
it might be used for.

\subsection{What is FahMon?}

FahMon is an open-source tool (GPL license) that allows you to quickly check the
progress of your Folding@Home client (or clients if you have several), avoiding
you having to open different files and/or to go to the Internet (for example to
know how much your current work unit is worth). Other monitoring tools exist
(such as Electron Microscope, FahSpy and InCrease), so if you don't like FahMon,
have a look at them!

FahMon is entirely coded in C++ and uses the wxWidgets library, which allows
FahMon to exist both for Linux, Windows and OS X. It is designed to be really
easy to use, and you should thus not encounter any major problems.

\subsection{What is FahMon not?}

FahMon is not a Folding@Home client manager, it is designed solely to monitor
clients.

\subsection{What can FahMon be used for?}

FahMon can be used to simply check how far along your clients are on their
current WUs. It can also track the performance of clients on different WUs
thanks to its benchmark database. You can use FahMon to publish client stats
to the web for remote monitoring too.

\subsection{Licenses}

FahMon is licensed under the GNU General Public License; a copy of this license
is included in the file \url{COPYING}.
FahMon also includes wxCurl which is licensed under the wxWidgets license which
can be found here \url{http://www.wxwidgets.org/about/newlicen.htm}

For more information on the licenses, please visit the \url{opensource.org}
website.

\section{Installing FahMon}

This section describes how to install FahMon.

\subsection{Windows}

Windows users can either download a zipped version of FahMon, or as an
installer. The two are identical except for the method of installation. The
installer will create Start menu entries for you and install itself into
\texttt{\%PROGRAM FILES\%}. The zipped version can simply be extracted wherever
you want. You will need to create your own shortcuts etc. for the zipped
version.

\subsection{Linux}

\subsubsection{Packages}

If a package exists for your Linux distribution on the download page, it is
easiest to use that. Note that some distributions maintain FahMon as part of
their standard software repositories (Arch Linux for example does this), so it
is often worthwhile checking your package manager to see if someone has done the
hard work for you already.

\subsubsection{Compiling from source}

Compiling from source is \textit{harder} than installing from a pre-built
package, however it is not \textit{that} hard.

\paragraph{Prerequisites}

\begin{itemize}
 \item A C++ compiler. gcc-c++ (g++) is the usual compiler for most Linux
 distributions.
 \item The unicode wxGTK libraries and their development headers. Version 2.8.0
 is the minimum required.
 \item libcurl. This is usually installed when you install curl itself. Some
 distributions also appear to require that you install the development headers
 too.
\end{itemize}

The simplest way to install the above software is to open your package manager
and search for the software to install if you don't already know the package
names.

The following table lists the package names of the required components form a
number of common distributions.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l}
\textbf{Component}   & \textbf{Ubuntu}       & \textbf{Fedora}        &
\textbf{PCLinuxOS} \\
\hline
\textit{gcc-g++}     & g++                            & gcc-c++                &
gcc-c++ \\
\textit{wxGTK}       & libwxgtk2.8-dev                & wxgtk-devel            &
wxgtk2.8-devel \\
\textit{libcurl }    & libcurl3, libcurl4-openssl-dev & libcurl, libcurl-devel &
libcurl3, libcurl3-devel \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Compiling}

You normally only need to issue 3 commands after navigating to the source folder
in a terminal

\texttt{./configure}\\
Optionally you can include a prefix parameter, which affects the install
location. If this doesn't complete successfully, check the errors, which will
usually be about a missing package. If it worked, continue:

\texttt{make}\\
This will take a while as it compiles the source. No errors should occur. Ignore
any warnings. You now need to log in as root to install. Different distributions
have different ways of achieving this. So either:

\texttt{sudo make install}\\
This will work for ubuntu and other sudo-enabled distributions and will prompt
you for you sudo password.

OR

\texttt{su -c \textquotedblright make install\textquotedblright}\\
This will work for non-sudo distributions and will prompt you for your root
password.

Depending on your system configuration you may find that you also need to run
ldconfig in order for FahMon to find the new libwxcurl library. To do this
either run

\texttt{sudo ldconfig}

OR

\texttt{su -c \textquotedblright ldconfig\textquotedblright}


\subsection{OS X}

The package for OS X is in the form of a zipped universal binary. Installation
is as simple as extracting the archive and copying FahMon into your applications
folder.


\section{Using FahMon}

\subsection{First launch}

When you launch FahMon for the first time, you should get a dialog like this
one:

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=9cm]{1.png}
 % 1.png: 515x411 pixel, 72dpi, 18.17x14.50 cm, bb=0 0 515 411
\end{center}


It suggests that you should download the new projects definition from the
Folding@home website. This definition contains information required by FahMon to
display deadlines, calculate points-per-day etc. Beware that if you need to use
a proxy for HTTP connections, you should not download the definition here as it
will fail; you will have to first change the proxy settings in preferences, then
update the project definition.


\subsection{GUI overview}

The default layout for FahMon is that of a simple list of clients. This is laid
out in a tabular format with various pieces of information shown in columns.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=15cm]{2.png}
 % 2.png: 870x307 pixel, 72dpi, 30.69x10.83 cm, bb=0 0 870 307
\end{center}

The columns that are displayed can be altered by right-clicking the column
header and selecting the columns you wish to appear in the pop-up menu. Altering
the order of columns is not supported. Various actions can be performed on the
clients by right-clicking their entries in the client list. This includes
editing details, and individually enabling/disabling monitoring of a particular
client. Double-clicking on an entry will open up your file-manager at the
location FahMon is monitoring for a given client.

The statusbar at the bottom of the FahMon window is split into three sections.
The left-most will display hints for various menu items, as well as warning you
about any potential problems that wouldn't normally be apparent. The middle
section will display the monitored location of the currently selected client. If
you are monitoring via ftp or HTTP, the username and password will be masked.
The right-most section will display the total calculated PPD from all monitored
clients.

By default FahMon does not display the contents of FAHlog.txt for any clients.
You can enable this display from the view menu which will expand the layout and
show the log for the current client below the client list.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=15cm]{3.png}
 % 3.png: 870x662 pixel, 72dpi, 30.69x23.35 cm, bb=0 0 870 662
\end{center}

An alternative layout is available and will be familiar to users of previous
versions of FahMon. To enable this select \textit{Show/Hide WU Info Panel}. This
will create a panel on the right-hand side of the client-list which shows
various pieces of information based on the currently selected client. In this
layout a progress bar for the current client is shown beneath the client list.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=12cm]{4.png}
 % 4.png: 792x307 pixel, 72dpi, 27.94x10.83 cm, bb=0 0 792 307
\end{center}




\subsection{Adding clients}

Adding clients for FahMon to monitor can be accomplished in two different ways.
The first, which is simplest if you have machines on a local network is to drag
the folder in which FahMon should monitor onto the client list. The second way
is either right-click the client list and select \textit{Add a new client}, or
select the same from the \textit{Clients} menu.

However you choose to add a client, the \textit{Client edition} dialog will
appear.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{5.png}
 % 5.png: 328x186 pixel, 72dpi, 11.57x6.56 cm, bb=0 0 328 186
\end{center}


Here is where you tell FahMon where the new client is located. If you
dragged-and-dropped your new client, this will be filled in for you. You also
need to choose a name for each client you add. This name can be anything you
want, it's just like a nickname for the client. Most people tend to use the
computer name and client type or number e.g. \textit{Machine1 - GPU1}.

Clients being monitored on remote machines may be accessed by a number of
different methods. If the machines are accessible via Windows Network Shares
(SMB/SAMBA) then you can use their UNC path as the monitoring location on
Windows machines e.g. \textbackslash\textbackslash machine1\textbackslash
Folding1. If you are using Linux/OS X you will need to mount these into your
filesystem as there is no facility to access SMB shares directly in FahMon.

Remote clients may also be accessed via FTP or HTTP if available. Monitoring
these clients is as simple as entering the correct URI in the format
\textit{http://username:password@server/path/to/client/} or
\textit{ftp://username:password@server/path/to/client/}

If you are monitoring a client running as a guest inside a Virtual Machine such
as VMWare, it is recommended that you check the box for this on the client
edition dialog. This will enable some extra heuristics to account for the fact
that VMWare guests often have trouble keeping their clock synchronised with the
host machine. Leaving this box unchecked for a VM guest may result in erroneous
\textit{Hung} or \textit{Inactive} states being triggered. This heuristic is a
workaround and is not 100\% reliable; to improve monitoring of VM guests it is
recommended that they regularly synchronise with an NTP server to eliminate
asynchrony with the host machine clock.

\textbf{Note}: On Windows systems running the v6 Systray clients, the location
you need to enter is the folder inside ``\texttt{Documents and
Settings\textbackslash UserName\textbackslash Application Data\textbackslash
Folding@home\textbackslash CLIENT}'' (XP) or ``\texttt{Users\textbackslash
UserName\textbackslash AppData\textbackslash Roaming\textbackslash CLIENT}''
(Vista).

Once a client has been added FahMon will start monitoring it and will populate
the various fields in the client list with information as it becomes available.

\subsection{The monitoring process}

The default behaviour for FahMon is to automatically reload any \textit{local
clients} (local being defined as anything in the current filesystem, or
accessible by UNC) every 5 minutes, and any \textit{internet clients} (via ftp
or HTTP) every 10 minutes. These intervals can be altered if required.

Clients can also be reloaded manually by either right-clicking a client and
selecting \textit{Reload client} or selecting the same from the \textit{Clients}
menu. The \textit{Clients} menu also offers the option to reload all clients.
Choosing either of these options forcibly reloads any clients regardless of any
other monitoring options (except for a client being disabled).

The monitoring process relies on a number of files being available for FahMon to
read:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{FAHlog.txt}
  \\This most obvious source of data and is parsed for current progress, client
status and is used to calculated the frame count.
 \item \textbf{unitinfo.txt}
  \\This is used to obtain current progress when unobtainable from FAHlog.txt.
 \item \textbf{queue.dat}
  \\This is parsed for information about the current WU including PRCG (Project,
Run, Clone, Generation), and assignment specific data.
 \item \textbf{work/logfile\_xx.txt}
  \\This file is parsed for current core version. On Linux this information
might not be available due to the file-permissions set by the core.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Client status}

The current status of a client is denoted by a small coloured square at the left
of each client in the list.

There are 6 different colours:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Black}
  \\FahMon is unable to access to the directory where this client is located.
 \item \textbf{Red}
  \\The client is currently stopped.
 \item \textbf{Orange}
  \\The client is currently paused.
 \item \textbf{Yellow}
  \\The client seems to be inactive or in an unknown state. The former happens
   most of the time when the elapsed time since the last completed frame is too
   high (this happens if another process is using the processor). An unknown
   state occurs when FahMon does not have sufficient information to decide
   whether the client is running or not. Check the Messages Window to find out
   what is happening.
 \item \textbf{Blue (optional)}
  \\The client has been flagged as having an asynchronous clock, this state is
   also triggered when the monitoring machine passes over 00:00 local time. The
   basic meaning of this state is that the client is still working, but you
   \textit{may} need to check on it.
 \item \textbf{Green}
  \\Everything is OK, FahMon should display all information about this client,
   as long as the project database is up to date.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional features}

\subsubsection{Benchmarks database}

FahMon keeps a record of the performance of all your WUs on each machine that is
monitored. These data are stored in the benchmarks database which shows you the
PPDs for each machine that has completed a given project. For clients currently
running, you can see the result from all 5 PPD calculation algorithms; for
stopped clients you can only see the minimum and average frame times.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=10cm]{6.png}
 % 6.png: 558x377 pixel, 72dpi, 19.68x13.30 cm, bb=0 0 558 377
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Message window}

FahMon's message window is used to log various error messages and other
important status messages. This window is useful if clients aren't reloading
properly as this can usually tell you why. If logging of non-error messages is
enabled the message window will also log FTP transactions, and provide info on
reloading status etc.

The message windows also serves to provide a copy of the copyright and licence
notice (this cannot be removed).

\begin{center}

 % 7.png: 720x427 pixel, 72dpi, 25.40x15.06 cm, bb=0 0 720 427
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Web links}

A number of useful web links are provided on the \textit{Web} menu. These are as
follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{My Stats}
  \\This links directly to your Stanford stats page using the username and team
number from the currently selected client.
 \item \textbf{Jmol}
  \\This links to \url{http://www.jmol.org/} to provide visualisation data for
the project running on the currently selected client (relies on submissions)
 \item \textbf{fahinfo.org}
  \\This links to \url{http://fahinfo.org/}, and alternative project data site
that automatically keeps up-to-date data on every project released.
 \item \textbf{F@H Website}
  \\This links to \url{http://folding.stanford.edu/}, the official Folding@home
website.
 \item \textbf{Folding Forum}
  \\This links to \url{http://foldingforum.org/}, the official Folding@home
support forum.
 \item \textbf{Projects Summary}
  \\This links to \url{http://fah-web.stanford.edu/psummary.html} which shows
the current active project list
 \item \textbf{Servers status}
  \\This links to \url{http://fah-web.stanford.edu/serverstat.html} which shows
the current Folding@home server statuses.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Web export}

FahMon has the ability to automatically export up to 3 formatted web-pages based
on the data obtained from the clients it is monitored. By default these are 3
specific types of output, but since the output is governed by a templating
system, completely unique output is possible.

FahMon provides 3 templates; A fancy, Javascript powered page designed to mimic
the FahMon interface from version 2.3.2; A simple, low-bandwidth formatted
table; and a simple plain text template for easy access via ssh.

The web output feature of FahMon is activated from the preferences dialog and is
able to automatically upload the pages to an ftp server if provided with a valid
URI.

\section{Configuring FahMon}

This section describes how to configure FahMon from the preferences dialog, and
also explains some of the more advanced features.

\subsection{General}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Enable system tray icon} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Place an icon in the system tray to which FahMon will minimise. This also
   provides a right-click menu to access the preferences and benchmarks dialogs
   in addition to a tooltip showing pertinent information.
 \item \textbf{Collect .xyz files} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\These files are generated by the client and allow third-party tools to
   display proteins in 3D (see Jmol website for example). If you select this
   option, the .xyz files will automatically be collected in a directory named
   \textit{xyz}.
 \item \textbf{Auto update projects database when needed} \textit{Default -
   enabled}
  \\When a new unknown project is downloaded by a monitored client, you will
   have to update the projects database to obtain information about this
   project. If you select this, FahMon will try to automatically download the
   new definitions when needed.
 \item \textbf{Always list inaccessible clients last} \textit{Default - enabled}
  \\Make sure that however the clients are sorted, inaccessible (black) clients
   always get listed last.
 \item \textbf{Start minimised} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Start FahMon minimised - usually used in conjunction with the system tray
   icon.
 \item \textbf{Check for FahMon updates at startup} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Automatically polls the FahMon website at every launch to see if a newer
   version is available.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monitoring}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Auto reload clients} \textit{Default - enabled}
  \\If you select this option, FahMon will automatically reload the monitored
   clients at the desired frequency.
 \item \textbf{Use experimental reload system (local only)} \textit{Default -
  disabled}
  \\Checks the file modification times every 10 seconds and only proceeds to
   reload the client if the log has changed. This reduces processing load, and
   allows more "real-time" updates of client states. It is current experimental
   as it can cause some clients to fail to update at all if they are being
   accessed over a network. Windows (SAMBA) shares seem to be affected by this
   as the modification times sometimes don't seem to update as they should. NFS
   shares aren't affected.
 \item   \textbf{Local client reload interval (mn)} \textit{Default - 5}
  \\Reload all local (Current filesystem and UNC paths) clients with this time
   interval.
 \item   \textbf{HTTP/FTP client reload interval (mn)} \textit{Default - 10}
  \\Reload all HTTP/FTP clients with this time interval. This is also the
   interval at which web output is created.
 \item \textbf{Reload clients in series} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\This will perform reloads in the same thread instead of created a new thread
   for each client. This consumes slightly less memory at the expense of
   marginally slower reloads.
 \item   \textbf{Display dates as} \textit{Default - Time left}
  \\This allows you to change the format used to display the ETA and deadline
   information.
 \item   \textbf{Calculate PPD based on} \textit{Default - Last 3 frames}
  \\Allows you to choose which algorithm is used to display the PPD in the main
   window. The default behaviour is ``Last 3 frames'', which calculates an
   average PPD based on a rolling 3 frame average. ``All frames'' uses a stored
   database of 255 previous values. ``Last frame only'' gives the instantaneous
   PPD. ``Effective rate'' takes into account client downtime and projects this
   forward to predict the final ETA.
 \item   \textbf{Ignore asynchronous clocks} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Prevents clients whose local clocks are not perfectly synced with the
   monitoring machines clock from turning orange/yellow. When this option is
   enabled, the clients turn blue and a message is noted in the log.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Networking}
\begin{itemize}
 \item   \textbf{Use a proxy for HTTP connections} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Select this option if you need to use a proxy for HTTP connections.
 \item   \textbf{Proxy requires authentication} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Select this option if you need to use authentication with your proxy. Beware
   that once saved, the password will not be directly human readable from the
   disk, but an attacker will easily be able to retrieve it.
 \item   \textbf{Use a proxy for FTP connections} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Select this option if you need to use a proxy for HTTP connections.
 \item   \textbf{Proxy requires authentication} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Select this option if you need to use authentication with your proxy. Beware
   that once saved, the password will not be directly human readable from the
   disk, but an attacker will easily be able to retrieve it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advanced}
\begin{itemize}
 \item   \textbf{Use the following settings for new project downloads}
  \\\textit{Default - http://fah-web.stanford.edu/psummary.html}
  \\This setting allows you to alter the online data source for project
   information. Unticking this box will result in default values being used.
 \item   \textbf{Use a local file for project data} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Uses a locally stored version of psummary.html (.html extension is
   important) to update the project database. This is useful for times when
   psummary isn't up-to-date with projects being assigned, like is the case with
   Win-SMP WUs.
 \item \textbf{Log error messages only} \textit{Default - enabled}
  \\Ignore any non-error messages in the log. This will not prevent the
   Copyright and Licence notice from being displayed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System}
\begin{itemize}
\item   \textbf{Web Browser (Linux Only)} \textit{Default - }
  \\You should specify the web-browser you wish to use for opening web-links
   here. This replaces the old method of exporting the browser as an environment
   variable used in previous versions of FahMon.
\item   \textbf{File Manager} \textit{Default - Platform dependent}
  \\Select the file manager you wish to use to open client folder with. The
   default setting for Windows is ``Windows Explorer'', for Linux it is
   ``Konqueror''.
\item   \textbf{File Manager Command} \textit{Default - Platform dependent}
  \\Alter the command used to execute your file manager.
\item   \textbf{Manually set timezone to UTC + ...} \textit{Default - disabled}
  \\Allows you to override the timezone that is automatically detected. This
   provides a workaround for the bug in wxwidgets that causes DST timezones to
   be reported incorrectly, which in turn causes state detection, ETA
   calculation etc to be incorrect or fail. Only whole hours can be selected at
   present.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{WebApp 1}
The names of the components on this page reflect the default behaviour of
FahMon, but does not mean that this behaviour needs to be adhered to if creating
custom templates.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Export *} \textit{Default - Disabled}
  \\These allow FahMon to create a formatted web page based upon a simple
   templating system. Each of these 3 boxes will allow a separate page to be
   generated. These pages can either be saved to a local file, or uploaded via
   FTP to a remote web server. For FTP upload, a correctly formatted URI needs
   to be entered in the form\\
   \textit{ftp://username:password@server/path/to/upload/file.html}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{WebApp 2}
The names of the components on this page reflect the default behaviour of
FahMon, but does not mean that this behaviour needs to be adhered to if creating
custom templates.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Custom * Template} \textit{Default - Disabled}
  \\These configure the template files FahMon will use to generate any enabled
   web outputs from. For information on templating, see the
\url{TEMPLATE_SYNTAX}
   file.
\end{itemize}

\section{FahMon Commands Overview}

FahMon has a number of command-line options, however these are for advanced
users only.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{-v, --version}
  \\Displays the current version number.
 \item \texttt{-s, --stress}
  \\Run FahMon in stress-test mode. This is meant only for trying to replicate
   reloading bugs by forcibly reloading all clients every 0.5 seconds.
 \item \texttt{-l, --local} \textit{Windows only}
  \\This option tells FahMon to store all settings in it's own folder, rather
   than using the standard \%APPDATA\% location.
\end{itemize}
