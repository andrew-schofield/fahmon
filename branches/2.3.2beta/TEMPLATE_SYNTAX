This file descibes the syntax used for creating templates for the web output
system.

Template pages can be written in whatever language you like, provided that the
keywords used in the template definition are not reserved in that language.

Throughout this document quotation marks "" are used to surround blocks of code.
These are not part of the actual definitions.

Defining Template Blocks
========================

Template blocks are opened and closed using modified html comments.
To open a template block, use the following code:

"<!--tpl_TYPE "

To close a template block, use the following code:

" tpl//-->"

The leading and trailing spaces in the above two blocks of code are important
and must be included.

Template blocks can contain any text, in addition to a number of predefined
variables which are demarkated by @ symbols, which are the only characters you
can't include within the template blocks.

There are two values that "TYPE" can take, these are "static" and "loop".
A static template means that it is only processed once while reading the file.
A loop template is processed for each monitored client whilst the file is read.

For example the following template block will be transformed into a single line
when the template file is processed. This is useful for showing data like total
PPD or update time.

"<!--tpl_static Total PPD: @TOTAL_PPD@ //-->"

The output of this template would be:

"Total PPD: 123.45"

The following looped template block will be processed for all the clients being
monitored by FahMon. This is used to list client data.

"<!--tpl_loop @NAME@ - @ETA@ - @PPD@ tpl//->"

The output of this template would be:

"Client1 - 01/01/01 00:00 - 123.45"
"Client2 - 02/01/01 03:45 - 246.80"
"Client3 - 03/01/01 16:20 - 987.65"

Template blocks can span multiple lines, however only one template block can
appear on any one line.

This is valid:

"<!--tpl_loop <td>@NAME@</td>
<td>@PPD@</td> tpl//-->"

This is not valid:

"<!--tpl_static @TOTAL_PPD@ tpl//-->Some text<!--tpl_static @UPDATE_TIME@
 tpl//-->"

Template Variables
==================

A number of template variables are defined to access data provided by FahMon:
"@PERCENTAGE@"		Returns the progress of a client
"@NAME@"			Returns the client name
"@ETA@"				Returns the client ETA
"@PPD@"				Returns the client PPD
"@CORE@"			Returns the core of the project the client is working on
"@PRCG@"			Returns the PRCG of the project the client is working on
"@POINTS@"			Returns the points of the project the client is working on
"@USER_TEAM@"		Returns the username and team of the client
"@DOWNLOAD_DATE@"	Returns the download date for the client
"@PREFERRED_DATE@"	Returns the preferred deadline for the client
"@FINAL_DATE@"		Returns the final deadline for the client
"@STATE_COLOR@"		Returns the hex color related to the clients state
"@STATE@"			Returns a string related to the clients state
"@FAHMON_VERSION@"	Returns the FahMon title bar string
"@UPDATE_TIME@"		Returns the time of the last page update
"@TOTAL_PPD@"		Returns the total PPD of all clients being monitored
"@STATE_IMAGE@"		Returns the location of the client state image
"@CLIENT_ID@"		Returns the ID of the current client

Each template variable can also contain an optional string that will allow the
output to be padded or truncated to a specific length. This is implemented so
that the default simple text output is formatted correctly.
To use this option, enclose the desired length in "{}" and put it directly
preceding the closing "@".
For example, the truncate the state string to only 5 characters:

"@STATE{5}@"

For more examples, examine the templates provided with FahMon.
