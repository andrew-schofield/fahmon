BODY:
<p>The latest and greatest version of FahMon has just been released, after several rounds of testing 
and breaking (thanks to all who tested various features). You can get to the most up-to-date version 
of FahMon by going to the download page, which now uses static links which automatically resolve to 
the latest version available.</p>
<p>The download page also has a link to the comprehensive changelog.</p>
<p>Things to look out for in this version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified how you add clients: Drag and drop the client folder into the client list, fill in the 
name, and away you go.
<li>Export to Web: A new "WebApp" module has been added which presents you with various ways of publishing 
the FahMon output to either webpages, or static text files. The Web Application option exports a fancy 
javascript powered webpage which mimics the FahMon interface.
<li>Update checking: FahMon can now check if a newer version is available online. This can be done 
automatically on startup, or manually from the FahMon menu 
</ul>
<p>If you find any bugs with this version, please use trac, the online project manager to report them.
