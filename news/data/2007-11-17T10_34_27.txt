BODY:
<p>Starting with FahMon 2.3.2, several pieces of data crucial to FahMon's operation will now be 
obtained directly from queue.dat, since this is the only reliable source for these data.</p>
<p>To this end, some of the core code from qd has been ported into FahMon to access data from the 
queue in a tried and trusted fashion.</p>
<p>My thanks go to Dick Howell and Bas Couwenberg for this code.</p>
<p>With the introduction of qd into FahMon, the messages windows now displays the following licence text 
upon startup:</p>
<pre>FahMon <version> is licenced under the GNU GPL v2
Copyright (C) 2003-2007 Francois Ingelrest
Copyright (C) 2007 Andrew Schofield
   
FahMon contains code from qd, also licenced under the GNU GPL v2
Copyright (C) 2002-2005 Richard P. Howell IV.
Copyright (C) 2005-2007 Sebastiaan Couwenberg</pre>
<p>The overall upshot of these changes is that FahMon should be much more stable, and no longer crash 
or mangle machine names when monitoring large numbers of clients.</p>
