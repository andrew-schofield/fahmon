BODY:
<p>Trac's ticket system now sends out email notifications when tickets are created/modified. So if you have set up and email address in your profile, you will 
automatically be sent an email when replies are posted, or the bug you reported is fixed etc.</p>
<p>Emails are sent from trac(@)fahmon.net, but you will receive no response if you reply to this address</p>
