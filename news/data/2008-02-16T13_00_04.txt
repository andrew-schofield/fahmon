BODY:
<p>It has come to my attention that the system tray icon restore behaviour is still broken in this 
release, and may in fact actually be worse than previous versions.<br />I believe this is actually due 
to a broken compile, as the code added did work during testing. Unfortunately I cannot release a 
recompiled build until early next week as I have to create a fresh Virtual Machine of XP and the 
FahMon build environment owing to my current VM now being broken beyond all usefulness.</p>
<p>If you do experience significant problems with the current build of 2.3.2a, switch back to 2.3.2 
until I can recompile 2.3.2a correctly again.</p>

<p>Please note: This issue does <i>not</i> affect Linux or OS X users.</p>
