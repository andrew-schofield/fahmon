BODY:
<p>For those of you interested in downloading bleeding edge code, 
svn revision r38 is reasonably stable and adds a few new features in 
addition to a number of bug-fixes</p>
<p>To download this specific revisions, you can either download the 
snapshot as a zip file from <a 
href="http://trac.fahmon.net/changeset/38/trunk?old_path=%2F&amp;format=zip">here</a> or you can export it from the svn repository using the following command (you should be able to do this anonymously):</p>
<pre>svn export -r38 http://svn.fahmon.net/trunk fahmon</pre>
<p>This revision contains the following changes:</p>
<pre>
* Updated and improved documentation (this is still "Work
  in Progress").
* Added Czech translation.
* Preferences dialog and client list now save changes
  immediately, which should help in situations where FahMon
  crashes, like fast-user-switching or closing RDP/VNC
  sessions.
* Added Drag-and-Drop function to the client list to allow
  new clients to be added more easily.
* Add Gromacs SMP CVS (GROCVS) core support.
* Adjusted margin on the benchmarks dialog.
* Fixed bug in "Effective Duration" code that produced
  incorrect results when calculating values for WUs with
  less than 100 frames
* Detailed instructions on how to compile fahmon using the
  MS Free Tools are now provided.
* Altered progress detection method to use FAHlog.txt, this
  should help with cores that don't update unitinfo.txt in
  a timely fashion, or at all. Unitinfo.txt is still used
  as a fallback if 1) The projectId is unknown, 2) The WU
  is still in the "startup" phase (i.e. yellow).
* Added WebApp module. You can now export the monitoring
  status to 3 different formats, WebApp - a fancy jscript
  powered web page that mimics the FahMon interface; Simple
  Web - a simple web page containing useful data arranged
  in a simple table; Simple Text - similar to Simple Web,
  but optimised for shell based viewing - useful for
  monitoring over SSH.</pre>
