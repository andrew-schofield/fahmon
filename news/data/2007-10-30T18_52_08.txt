BODY:
<p>I've just posted some precompiled binary pacakges for both PCLinuxOS, and Ubuntu (i386 and amd64).</p>
<p>The ubuntu packages were produced on 7.10 (gutsy) so they might not work on 7.04 (feisty). Judging by the wxgtk library used, I suspect they won't.</p>
<p>I did plan on releasing the SUSE and Fedora RPMs at the same time, but my SUSE installation is in the middle of a major system update, and my Fedora box appears to 
have dropped off the network for some reason, so I'm going to have to go and work out what it's doing before I can make any fc7 packages.</p>
