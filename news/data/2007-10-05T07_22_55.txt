BODY:
<p>FahMon now has a nice new website which you are reading right 
now.</p>
<p>As well as being <i>the</i> source for downloading FahMon, it now 
integrates with trac and svn for the development and support side 
too.</p>
<p>Hopefully this should be easier for you as end users too, and you 
should be able to syndicate the RSS/ATOM news feeds for new releases, 
development news and information important to translators.</p>
<p>Since trac is being used to handle the project management, we now 
have a sophisticated bug tracking and milestone management system. 
This makes it very easy for you to submit bug reports and for me to 
manage them, and the project as a whole.</p>
<p>I'm still working on the trac side of things, so it doesn't allow 
you to create tickets etc. yet, but that will come soon.</p>
<p>Anyone can now browse the development source, either though the 
trac browser, or via the svn server itself at svn.fahmon.net</p>
<p>If you want to download the most recent development source, you 
can check it out from svn using your favourite svn client</p>
<pre>svn export http://svn.fahmon.net/trunk fahmon</pre>
