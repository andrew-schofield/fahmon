DESC: An unsupported release to test that bugs have been squashed
FORMAT: raw
-----
BODY:
<p>This is an unsupported beta release of FahMon to check a number of bug fixes to allow me to close 
various support tickets.</p>
<p>The specific behaviour that needs testing is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do 50 frame DGromacs WUs now report PPD and ETA correctly?
<li>Does reloading client information still cause high CPU usage in Windows?
<li>Does FahMon still enter a state that uses 100% CPU time when left running for several days on Windows?
<li>Do client locations still get corrupted when monitoring large (> ~30) numbers of clients (Windows or 
Linux)?
</ul>
<p>If you test this release please comment on the above bugs using the bug tracking system.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes so far please refer top the changelog for this release, and also check the 
tickets that have been reported for this release <a 
href="http://trac.fahmon.net/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&status=closed&group=status&milestone=2.3.2&order=priority">here</a></p>
<p>One bug that has not yet been fixed is ticket #77 where the web output is displayed incorrectly in IE 
7. This will be fixed in the official release.</p>
<br />
<p>This release also represents the an opportunity for translators to update the translation files ready 
for the official release. This time there are only very minor changes to the files required.<br/>
Any budding web designers may want to try out the templating system in this release too</p>
