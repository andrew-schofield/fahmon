BODY:
<p>FahMon version 2.3.1pre1 is now ready for translators to update the translations ready for the 
upcoming 2.3.1 release.</p>
<p>The second prerelease is necessary due to a bug being found in 2.3.1pre which had several translations missing.</p>
<p>2.3.1pre1 also includes some code updates commited after 2.3.1pre was released.</p>
<p>For existing translations there are an additional 30 strings that need translating.</p>

<p>If FahMon doesn't exist in in your native language, and you'd like it to, now is an excellent time to start translating it.</p>
