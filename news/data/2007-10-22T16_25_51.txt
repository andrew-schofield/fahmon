BODY:
<p>Shello alerted me that the permission were set up wrong in trac which meant that new users couldn't 
actually create tickets. In fact, they had no more privildges than un registered users.</p>
<p>This has now been fixed, and users registered on trac.fahmon.net can now create tickets for bug 
reports and feature requests.</p>
