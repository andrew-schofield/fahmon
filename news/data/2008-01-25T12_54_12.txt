BODY:
There have been a couple of reports of undocumented bugs in the 2.3.2beta release which have now been 
fixed in SVN. It is likely that a beta2 will be released in the near future to check that these bugs are 
no longer present.
<ul>
<li>FahMon will crash if the project database doesn't contain project info for a WU it is monitoring.
<li>The simple web output erroneously adds an extra "points" string to the credit field.
<li>Several text items on all web output files cannot be translated.
</ul>
