BODY:
<p>Some static links have now been set up so that people can link to the most recent version of FahMon 
without having to worry about what version number to use.</p><p>Using these links in forums etc. 
guarantees 
that people can always get the most recent version of FahMon without necessarily having to visit the 
FahMon website.</p><p>This will also prevent people fom downloading outdated versions because links in 
forums point to specific versions.</p>
<p>The links to use are:<br />
Windows <a 
href="http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?windows">http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?windows</a><br/>
Linux <a 
href="http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?linux">http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?linux</a></p>
