<p>Here's a brief overview of what's new in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of bug fixes in this release to make FahMon more stable, there should be
  far fewer instances of FahMon crashing for no apparent reason, and CPU usage
  whilst reloading clients has been decreased.
<li>Several bits of data are now retreived using core code from qd (Queue Dumper)
  <a href="http://linuxminded.xs4all.nl/?target=software-qd-tools.plc">
  http://linuxminded.xs4all.nl/?target=software-qd-tools.plc</a>.
<li>Web output is now completely configurable thanks to a new templating system
  which allows you to create custom output pages.
<li>Documentation should now be much more understandable.
</ul>
<p>Several translation updates were missed for this version, so if you notice missing translations 
whilst using FahMon and feel like updating them, send them along to me and I'll incorporate them into 
the builds on the website.</p>
<p>As always if you find any bugs in FahMon please report them using <a href="http://trac.fahmon.net/">
