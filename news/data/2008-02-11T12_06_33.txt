DESC: blogkomm + nanoblogger, a winning combination?
FORMAT: raw

BODY:
<p>I'm trying out a comment system for the news section of the site, so feel free to use it if you 
will.<br />The captcha can sometimes appear completely unreadable, so I recommend you refresh the page 
until it is readable and <i>then</i> start writing your comments.<br />Hopefully I can get that fixed.</p>
<p>The software powering the comments is a nifty set of php scripts called <a 
href="http://blogkomm.com/">blogkomm</a> which I've integrated into nanoblogger.</p>
