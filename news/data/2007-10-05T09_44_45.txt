BODY:
<p>For the existing translators out there, and for any potential new 
translators, this is the section you want to be watching to stay up 
to date with when new translations are required.</p>
<p>This generally means you'll get a few days advance on everyone 
else for downloading the official release, however it won't be 
officially supported, and should really only be used for checking 
that your new translations work etc.</p>
<p>To subscribe to this website category, the best way is to go to 
the translations category link on the side bar and subscribe to the 
rss feed. Alternatively you can click on the rss/atom feeds on the 
"syndicate" panel on the right, which any modern browser will allow 
you to bookmark, or send to google reader.</p>
<p>To get involved in translations right away, all you need to 
download is the fahmon.pot file from the svn trunk (see the home 
page for the direct link). About a week or so prior to an official 
release, a new post will be made here to notify you of the 
prerelease translation source (if you are keen and keep up with 
development, you shouldn't have to do very much on the prerelease 
versions).</p>
<p>To submit your translations, at the moment the best way to do it 
is the submit a ticket on trac, and attach the .po file you have 
created. I can then merge that into the source.</p>
