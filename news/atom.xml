<p>A bit of what's new in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed WU info panel from default view.
<li>Lots of performance changes.
<li>You can now monitor clients via FTP and HTTP.
<li>You can upload web output to an FTP server automatically.
</ul>
<p><b>What happened to 2.4.0?</b><br />
As a result of the performance and memory fixes, a previously infrequent crash-bug has increased in 
prevalence and will take more time to fix. Since this is still unlikely to occur often I'm releasing the 
current code as it stands. 2.4.0 will be released as soon as this crash-bug is fixed.</p>

<p>What's new in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>This version fixes the nasty bug in 2.3.3 which cause clients to fail to update after non-specific 
periods of time. This was caused by a typo in the update queue handler which now works properly.
<li>CPU usage has been reduced slightly when refreshing clients thanks to a re-worked message logger.
<li>clientstab.txt is now tab-delimited. This has no effect on FahMon, but may break compatibility with 
other tools that read this file.

UAC on Vista when downloading project updates.

<![CDATA[<p>I'm writing this news post mainly to let members of the community know what's going on with FahMon development-wise, since there have been no new announcements since 
April.</p>
<b>Developments</b>
<p>For those of you who are not aware, FahMon is coded entirely in my spare time, which recently I have had virtually none of (writing theses was the main culprit). 
However, I'm about to start a major drive to get various bits of core code in FahMon up to scratch and more stable.<br />There are already a number of GUI enhancements in 
svn including re-organised menus (for those who were confused about the lack of a "client" menu), configurable columns in the main view and the ability to hide the "WU 
Information" panel. There may be a few more tweaks to the GUI being made of the next few days to try and make the whole thing a little slicker than in the current 
release.<br />After finishing the GUI updates I'll be taking a look at the innards of the monitoring code, and possibly re-writing major portions of it to increase 
stability, and compatibility (mainly with SMP clients inside Virtual Machines).</p>
<p>I also hope to be able to put together some build-bots to automatically compile the latest svn code to ease the testing process.</p>
<b>Contributing</b>
<p>There are a number of ways that you can help contribute to the development of FahMon, and only 1 of them requires you to have any programming knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug reporting. This is <i>very</i> important to help improve FahMon, because unless I know a bug exists, I can't fix it.
<li>Ideas for features. You guys might come up with something I had'nt thought of.
<li>Code contributions. I welcome any patches to code, from typos to new functions.
<li>Monetary donations. There's a paypal link on the homepage. There's no obligation, but if you want to donate, the facility is there.
