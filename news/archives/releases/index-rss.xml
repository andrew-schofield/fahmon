it.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive list of changes please view the changelog which is linked to from the homepage.</p>
<p>A bit of what's new in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed WU info panel from default view.
<li>Lots of performance changes.
<li>You can now monitor clients via FTP and HTTP.
<li>You can upload web output to an FTP server automatically.
</ul>
<p><b>What happened to 2.4.0?</b><br />
As a result of the performance and memory fixes, a previously infrequent crash-bug has increased in 
prevalence and will take more time to fix. Since this is still unlikely to occur often I'm releasing the 
current code as it stands. 2.4.0 will be released as soon as this crash-bug is fixed.</p>

it.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive list of changes please view the changlog which is linked to from the homepage.</p>
<p>What's new in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>This version fixes the nasty bug in 2.3.3 which cause clients to fail to update after non-specific 
periods of time. This was caused by a typo in the update queue handler which now works properly.
<li>CPU usage has been reduced slightly when refreshing clients thanks to a re-worked message logger.
<li>clientstab.txt is now tab-delimited. This has no effect on FahMon, but may break compatibility with 
other tools that read this file.
