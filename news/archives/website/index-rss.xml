<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm trying out a comment system for the news section of the site, so feel free to use it if you 
will.<br />The captcha can sometimes appear completely unreadable, so I recommend you refresh the page 
until it is readable and <i>then</i> start writing your comments.<br />Hopefully I can get that fixed.</p>
<p>The software powering the comments is a nifty set of php scripts called <a 
href="http://blogkomm.com/">blogkomm</a> which I've integrated into nanoblogger.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Trac's ticket system now sends out email notifications when tickets are created/modified. So if you have set up and email address in your profile, you will 
automatically be sent an email when replies are posted, or the bug you reported is fixed etc.</p>
<p>Emails are sent from trac(@)fahmon.net, but you will receive no response if you reply to this address</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Shello alerted me that the permission were set up wrong in trac which meant that new users couldn't 
actually create tickets. In fact, they had no more privildges than un registered users.</p>
<p>This has now been fixed, and users registered on trac.fahmon.net can now create tickets for bug 
reports and feature requests.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Some static links have now been set up so that people can link to the most recent version of FahMon 
without having to worry about what version number to use.</p><p>Using these links in forums etc. 
guarantees 
that people can always get the most recent version of FahMon without necessarily having to visit the 
FahMon website.</p><p>This will also prevent people fom downloading outdated versions because links in 
forums point to specific versions.</p>
<p>The links to use are:<br />
Windows <a 
href="http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?windows">http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?windows</a><br/>
Linux <a 
href="http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?linux">http://fahmon.net/downloads/current.php?linux</a></p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I've fixed the broken link on the previous downloads page that gave a 404 for version 2.2.2.</p>
<p>I've also managed to get the server to handle the extensions properly, so it should't try and load the download into a new window, rather it should actually download 
the file instead.</p>
<p>The site style has been altered to make it "wider", unfortunately this means that the fancy rounded text boxes have had to temporarily be removed, and IE 6 (and 
below) users will ahve to live with the fact the the news page doesn't centre properly in the browser window.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>FahMon now has a nice new website which you are reading right 
now.</p>
<p>As well as being <i>the</i> source for downloading FahMon, it now 
integrates with trac and svn for the development and support side 
too.</p>
<p>Hopefully this should be easier for you as end users too, and you 
should be able to syndicate the RSS/ATOM news feeds for new releases, 
development news and information important to translators.</p>
<p>Since trac is being used to handle the project management, we now 
have a sophisticated bug tracking and milestone management system. 
This makes it very easy for you to submit bug reports and for me to 
manage them, and the project as a whole.</p>
<p>I'm still working on the trac side of things, so it doesn't allow 
you to create tickets etc. yet, but that will come soon.</p>
<p>Anyone can now browse the development source, either though the 
trac browser, or via the svn server itself at svn.fahmon.net</p>
<p>If you want to download the most recent development source, you 
can check it out from svn using your favourite svn client</p>
<pre>svn export http://svn.fahmon.net/trunk fahmon</pre>]]></description>
