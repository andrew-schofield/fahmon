		<h3 class="title">Some more website issues fixed</h3>
		<div class="item-description">
			<p>I've fixed the broken link on the previous downloads page that gave a 404 for version 2.2.2.</p>
<p>I've also managed to get the server to handle the extensions properly, so it should't try and load the download into a new window, rather it should actually download 
the file instead.</p>
<p>The site style has been altered to make it "wider", unfortunately this means that the fancy rounded text boxes have had to temporarily be removed, and IE 6 (and 
below) users will ahve to live with the fact the the news page doesn't centre properly in the browser window.</p>
