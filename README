About:
======
FahMon is an open-source tool (GPL license) that allows you to quickly check the
progress of your Folding@Home client (or clients if you have multiple ones),
avoiding you having to open different files and/or to go to the Internet (for
example to know how much your current work unit is worth). Other monitoring
tools exist (such as Electron Microscope or FahLogStats), so if you don't like
FahMon, have a look at them!

FahMon is entirely coded in C++ and uses the wxWidgets library, which allows
FahMon to exist both for Linux and Windows. It is designed to be really easy to
use, and you should thus not encounter any major problem.

For a complete version history, please see the ChangeLog file.

Translations
============
The translations provided with FahMon should work with no user intervention on
both Linux and MS Windows provided they were installed correctly.

Editing existing translations
=============================
To edit existing translations, you can open the relevant .po file in your
gettext catalog editor (see REQUIRES) and start modifying the strings. On Linux,
these can be found in the po directory of the installation source, on MS
Windows, these can be found in the lang folder. Once you are happy with the
translations you have edited, you need to install them.

To install an edited translation on Linux, simply run "make update-gmo" then
"make install" (as root or sudo). This will compile the translation to a binary
file and install it into the relevant location.

To install the edited transltaion on MS Windows, you need to get you gettext
catalog editor to save a .mo file (poEdit wil do this). Save the file as
fahmon.mo into the relevant folder under the "lang" folder.

Restart FahMon and your new translations should appear.

Creating new translations
=========================
Make sure you have read the REQUIRES file.

Make sure you know the language code for your new translation (combine the two
letter language code from ISO 639-1 with the two letter country code from ISO
3166. See the existing translations for examples).

On Linux, copy fahmon.pot in the po folder, to 'your_translation_name'.po and
start editing. After saving your translation, open up configure.ac in the source
root directory, and navigate down to "ALL_LINGUAS" and add your new translation
to the list.
Run ./reconf; ./configure; make update-gmo; make install to add your new
translation. (This should not force a recompile of fahmon itself, unless you
passed different options to configure).

On Windows, make a folder under 'lang' with the name of your translation and
copy fahmon.pot into it. Rename this to a .po file and start editing it. Once
finished, save the .mo file as fahmon.mo and restart FahMon.

Once you've created translations, please create a support ticket using trac:
http://trac.fahmon.net/ and attach your new .po file.
Alternatively, email the .po file to andrew_s@fahmon.net
